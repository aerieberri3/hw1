## PayPal - Making Moves

PayPal is one of my favorite FinTech companies. They were FinTech before FinTech was even a thing. I love how a staying even steven with your friends and a cool new gizmo branched out into a new era of money management. 

## An Opportunity
Early days of the internet shopping lacked confidence and moved slowly - online commerce was a risky move for buyers and sellers. There were no guarantees. If a check bounced, or a package wasn't delivered the transacting parties had to hash it out themselves. Online retail had some transaction issues.   The digital marketplace needed a digital payment provider - to act as an intermediary. 
  
  ## The Beginning
 Max Levchin had already launched three start-ups when he attended a lecture at Stanford University by Peter Thiel. A partnership developed between Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, Luke Nosek and Ken Howrey and in 1998, they established Confinity to do Palm Pilot payments and cryptography. The next stop on the way to becoming an engineer introduced PayPal, an email-based payment software. It was a hit. Confinity merged with X.com, the online one stop shop for banking and insurance.  Elon Musk was CEO of X.com, at the time, but voted out by the board and the new company decided to call themselves PayPal. The Nasdaq welcomed PayPal in 2002. They were positioned for a big merge. 

## Coming in Hot

Three years after the invent of the email-based payment technology, in October of 2003 Pay Pal and ebay partner together. It was a big deal, like $1.5 billion big. During their partnership PayPal continued to evolve. They came out with their app during this time, which allowed user to send payments from their smart phones. They captured the gaming market by adding the payment method to Xbox and Switch. Small businesses use PayPal to conduct payment transactions outside of brick-and-mortar locals. PayPal also offers a wide variety of business analytics tools. These innovations came a great deal of success and encouraged shareholders to think independence.

## A Whole New World
PayPal and Ebay went their separate ways in 2014, with encouragement from Carl Icahn, a major shareholder. PayPal was once again a single, publicly traded company. They started acquiring companies like Xoom and Venmo Synchrony Bank partners with PayPal offering consumers PayPal branded credit cards.  The company has come a long way from its original vision of sending IOU's between Palm Pilots.
